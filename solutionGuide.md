1. Great answers to the pre-lab questions:
    1. Kerberos uses mutual authentication, where both the client and server verify each other using encrypted tickets from a trusted Key Distribution Center (KDC). This ensures that an attacker cannot intercept and impersonate either party. Data should thus be incromprehendable to anyone listening.
    2. Kerberos includes timestamps in its tickets, ensuring theyâ€™re only valid within a narrow timeframe. Nonces (unique identifiers) and session keys are also used to prevent ticket reuse.
    3. Modern Kerberos primarily uses AES (Advanced Encryption Standard), especially AES-256, which is a symmetric encryption algorithm, meaning the same key is used for both encryption and decryption.
    4. Kerberos tickets can be intercepted through various methods, such as man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks, where an attacker can eavesdrop on the communication between the client and the Key Distribution Center (KDC). This could happen if encryption is not properly configured or if attackers exploit vulnerabilities in the network or endpoint security. Additionally, ticket-granting tickets (TGTs) can be stolen through malware or by exploiting weak passwords to perform a Pass-the-Ticket (PTT) attack. To mitigate these risks, best practices include enforcing strong encryption (e.g., AES-256), using mutual authentication to ensure both client and server are verified, implementing secure network protocols (such as VPNs or TLS) to protect communication, regularly rotating service account keys, enabling two-factor authentication (2FA), and deploying endpoint protection measures to detect and prevent malware.
    5. As a single point of failure, securing the KDC involves restricting physical and network access, using strong authentication for KDC admins, keeping the system patched, and implementing redundancy. The initial distribution of keys, and further updates, must be taken very seriously.
    6. Kerberos requires synchronized clocks (within a 5-minute skew by default) to validate tickets. Unsynced clocks can cause authentication failures, opening potential denial-of-service vulnerabilities.
    7. The Kerberos Golden Ticket attack involves an attacker forging a Kerberos Ticket Granting Ticket (TGT) to gain unauthorized access to any service within a Windows domain. By compromising the Key Distribution Center (KDC) or obtaining the KRBTGT account hash (used for signing TGTs), the attacker can generate a valid TGT that allows them to impersonate any user, including administrators. To protect against this attack, organizations should implement strong password policies, ensure the KRBTGT account is regularly changed, employ network segmentation to limit the spread of compromises, and monitor for unusual authentication activity, especially involving TGT creation or requests.
    8. Microsoft's Kerberos implementation has flaws like weak default settings, potential backdoors, and compatibility issues that may reduce security. Admin access can completely undermine the separation of roles of kerberos.

2. The following code is an example of a completed project. As this lab is heavily code based, screenshots will NOT be provided as a solution. Instead, code snippets and heavy commenting is used.

4. Great answers to the post-lab questions:
    1. Separating authentication and authorization into logically distinct components enhances security by allowing each to be managed independently. Authentication verifies identity, while authorization determines access levels. This separation makes it easier to update or replace one without affecting the other, improves scalability, and allows for more flexible and granular control over access.
    2. If authentication and authorization components become misaligned, it can lead to inconsistent user access, such as authorized users being denied access or unauthorized users gaining privileges. This misalignment can create security vulnerabilities, complicate troubleshooting, and require more effort to synchronize and maintain the two components effectively.
